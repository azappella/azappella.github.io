### About

I am a Swiss/American entrepreneur/designer/coder. I am deeply interested in Philosophy/Economics/Game Theory/Software Engineering/Distributed Ledgers/Machine Learning.

In 2009, I started a [digital advertising consultancy](https://www.suisseo.ch) to help companies build digital marketing strategies. My partner and I grew the company for several years on the premise that our clients could and should have better return on their investments for their advertising spent. We designed & built tools to optimize our customers' campaigns and to provide actionable insights from the reporting data.

In 2012, I joined [Base7booking](https://www.base7booking.com) as a managing partner and product engineer right after the company was founded. There, I helped define and create the company's vision and strategy. I also ensured base7's product & engineering efforts were aligned with its business goals, while providing help and support to the engineering/product teams, both through communication and code. It was successfully sold to trivago in 2016.

In 2018, I joined [Lightstreams](https://www.lightstreams.network) as a managing partner to execute the vision of a decentralized ecosystem built on the principles of privacy, security, and performance.
